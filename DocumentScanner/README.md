# DOCUMENT SCANNER

The project aims to develop a document scanner application using C++ and OpenCV, which can detect documents in an image, apply a perspective transformation to rectify the document's perspective and enhance the document's readability through image processing techniques such as histogram equalization and adaptive thresholding. You can edit the document's corners for better detection and correction.

Added a DocumentScanner.exe
